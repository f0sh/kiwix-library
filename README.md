# Collection of kiwix libraries

[Kiwix](https://kiwix.org) is a software which allows you to browse websites offline using highly compressed [zim archives]. On this website you find a collection of up-to-date zim archives from various websites in addition to the awesome list of the [kiwix library](https://library.kiwix.org). 

## Collection

Currently the list of archives contains the following sites categorized by topics.
If you want to have a website added, you can create a [new request](issues/new) for a website. Once approved the zim archive will be added to the automated creation process and will be listet on the next [release](releases/latest).

### Software development

  - [GoLang documentation]()
  - [GoLang tutorial]()
  - [Python documentation]()
  - [Telegram documentation]()
  - [Hugo documentation]()

## How to use

The archives are not compatible with all available software tools, privided by [kiwix]() yet. So far the archives work with the following solutions:

  - [Kiwix PWA](https://pwa.kiwix.org)
  - [Kiwix Serve](https://kiwix.org/download)
  - [Kiwix Android App](https://kiwix.org)

Other solutions, like the [Kiwix browser extensions]() and the [iOS App]() are not yet functional, due to limited support of the new zim archive type. Once these tools are able to be used with the new zim archive type, you can use the archives provided here, too.

### Roadmap

  - [ ] Provide hosted webpage with overview, including adding requests / issues with [utterances]()
  - [ ] Provide a one-click full setup solution, with automatic updates of archives (kwix-serve, create library.xml, update-function, register browser search)
